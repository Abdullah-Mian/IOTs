Workshop Objectives:
2-3 workshops:
--Remotely operated bot over BLE/Wi-Fi Radio
--Cost effective and cheap production
--Bring To self learning Level


Purpose:
All interested people of this domain, to bring closer to robotics, encourage and give guidance so that they are self-sufficient.
--So that this will Be a genesis to a working body (community)
--Pooling of ideas & innovations
--And bring raising the bar of robotics automation to whole new level.


--Kaise karna hai:



--What is needed to build an Autonomous bot
--What sort of components are needed and to Give basic intro of their purpose & functionality.


--Introduction To Microcontrollers
Give a brief & a shallow Understanding

--Brief intro to motor drivers
--Thorough Details of power distribution

--END: Do's & Don'ts of every component


--Over the period of the workshops, Gradually Explain the depth of microcontrollers:
--OS
--architecture
--limitations, pros/cons
--comparison with industrial grade controllers
--Give Motor driver theory explanation, in 



Kyun KArna hai:
--Existing societies are non-hobbyists, Uninformed , Less knowlegdable & illiterate people.
--Working with them is futile.
--Their Interrupts waste all efforts made for the cause.
--Their competitions are quite costly, and their dimensions and weight categories(rules & regulations) are quite Insane and unreal. Especially considering the components and motors available in the local market


#For PPT
--Mention Necessity

To Build Mutable and Immutable systems that are self reliant for automation.
An example of a car:
--We need 
4 wheels
-4 motors
Batteries to power motor
--Motor driver for
